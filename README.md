# Jekyll + Foundation 6 Starter Site
This is a starter repository for Jekyll sites styled with Zurb Foundation 6. This repo includes a gulpfile with SASS sourcemaps, PHP support (for that occasional need), and serves everything up with Browsersync + live reloading.

I find I use this combination a lot, so I figured I might as well create a base version (which, once created, might as well be shared). Input welcome!
